## **"Vanilla" Powers:**
**+** Aqua Affinity\
**+** Fins\
**+** Like Water\
**+** Swim Speed

## **Custom Powers:**
**+** Water Stealth (90% transparency and completely ignored by hostile mobs when enabled underwater. Toggle with G. Now has a limited use time of 15 seconds, once the bar depletes it will need to be 100% full before the power activates again. If you deactivate the power before it hits 0, the recharge rate will be 4 times slower. This is to make it so there's a reason to hit 0 instead of just turning the power off right before it ends.)\
**+** Water Absorb (Regeneration 3 while submerged in water.)\
**+** Rain Absorb (Regeneration 1 while in the rain.)\
**+** Advanced Gills (The Gills power from Merlings, but with no downside on land.)\
**+** Wet Eyes (Custom version of Wet Eyes that makes it so it will always give Night Vision underwater.)\
**+** Fishy Appetite (Fish fills 1.5x more hunger and saturation.)\
**+** Water Combatant (You get crit damage while fast-swimming underwater.)

**-** Fragile (Custom version of fragile makes you have 8 hearts instead of 7.)\
**-** Aquatic Diet (You cannot eat any meat from land animals. Only fruits, veggies, and fish for you.)\
**-** Too Heavy (Full iron armor and above is too heavy for you and gives a slowness effect if you choose to wear it anyways.)\
**-** Heat Sensitivity (Being in hot biomes/the nether will slowly reduce the heat bar, which deals half a heart of damage every 2 seconds once depleted. Water buckets restore 30 seconds to this timer, to use a water bucket for this purpose you must hold it in your main hand and press your secondary action key. You will instantly get slowness/weakness when near lava or in the nether, regardless of the heat bar. Else you need to be below 25% heat bar before you get these effects. You now also have to be exposed to sunlight in order for hot biomes to drain your heat meter.)
